## Life Status â€“ End of Past Year ##


### 1. Values & Purpose ###

*The past year...*
#### 1. What went well?
- Started reading philosophy. And reading more.

#### 2. What did not go well?
- I value being honest, yet my avoidance of awkward or difficult conversations sometimes appears like I am being deceitful. At least to me. I need to detach from the discomfort and valiantly do or say what needs to be said.

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
- I valued spending time with family and made the move to do so this year. Additionally, I know I need to read more philosophy to help explore my own beliefs.

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
- I could definitely spend more time thinking. I know I busy myself and frequently see an inefficiency of not simultaneously doing something. E.g. running with a podcast. 

#### Other Qs...
#### Do I have a sense of purpose and direction in life?
Yes. Broadly speaking it is to positive impact the world. At present, I see myself still in a skill acquisition phase. The target is to be confident in my ability to create value without an employer. This year I've identified as a optimistic nihilist. In the very long run we're all dead, all of humanity. This leads me to believe that one should maximise joy in the world and reduce as much suffering as possible.

#### What do I want out of life?
A rich well lived life. One where I have constantly pursued knowledge, whether for the purposes of building things of benefit to others (tech) or reading philosophy, the world's problems, or transformative novels that help me understand the world better.

#### How do I want the world to be different?
Less poverty. A cleaner planet. Reduce inequality. Improve efficiency. Increase connection and understanding.

#### What is my philosophy of life?
Optimistic Nihilism. Do good. Constantly improve. Help others.

#### What are my fundamental values?
Take action. Never focus solely on wealth. Be happy and help others be happy.

#### What do I truly value?

#### Summary
2017 has been good on this front with sufficient movement in learning more and examining what I value. Additional, actions like moving countries have demonstrated a higher priority on life and what I value than what I have done in previous years.

#### Metrics
- Read some philosophy this year? Yes (plato's apologie, Descarte's meditations).
- Spent time deeply introspective with a close friend? Yes - Alina.

#### Rating
9/10

#### What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
10 day meditation! More reflective writing like this. Read more philosophy.


### 2. Contribution & Impact ###

*The past year...*
#### 1. What went well?
- Huge charitable contribution
- Left a legacy at the APS, transformed peoples working lives
- helping young devs in new job
- massive increase in OSS contributions
- readership and impact of blog

#### 2. What did not go well?
- business impact - osbuild

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
- donations
- teaching others and creating workplaces that people are happy in

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
- business
- leveraging existing impact for more impact. E.g. impact of blog, get subscribers.

#### Other Qs...
#### How am I giving value to the world?
- Knowledge - my blog has helped quite a lot of people this year. 

#### How much value?
#### How much money did I give away in the past year (assuming it made sense to do so)? Who did it go to? Did it have the most possible impact?
#### Am I taking responsibility for, and reducing, my environmental impact on the world?
#### Am I making a difference?
#### Am I contributing to important and worthy causes that I care about?
#### How much impact does my existence have (environmentally, socially, cognitively)?

#### Summary

#### Milestones/Accomplishments/Failures

#### Metrics
- Someone told me that I have made a big difference in their lives? Yes quite a few this year, particularly with leaving a workplace. Scott, Dylan, Ravin, Alina.
- 500+ avg monthly users on blog
- More than one person has said the blog has helped them. Gitanjali, Random on linkedin and Samir.
- Charitable donations: 
665.42 AUD x 3 (donation matched Alina+Ravin)
346.00 AUD x 8 (donation matched Alina + 2x Ravin plus donation matching thing sent from Alina)

#### Rating
8/10

#### What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here? ####
?


### 3. Location & Tangibles ###

*The past year...*
#### 1. What went well?
- Moved country, closer to family
- Massively reduced what I own

#### 2. What did not go well?
- Wasn't great at coordinating the sale of things. Thanks to Ben and Jeremy
- In my new location I haven't quite figured out the way to get enough introvert time and have periods of effectiveness e.g. hacking.

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
N/A
#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
N/A
#### Do I have material sufficiency?
Yes
#### Where do I live? Where is my home? Where in the world am I?
Kew, London
#### What is my living situation like?
With family - which is much more social than what I am used to. Can be quite onerous or annoying in terms of rules from Mary and Roy. But at the same time, very free for what one might expect in terms of living with family. Low interference in life.

#### Am I tied to one location? Am I readily mobile (if desired)?
More than any point in my life, I am ready to go at the drop of a hat. My belongings fit into a suitcase and backpack. Yet, I could just leave the suitcase worth of stuff in Kew.
#### How much stuff do I own? Do I have too many things?
Nope.
#### Is my life cluttered?
Nope.
#### Summary
The move went very well. In fact it couldn't have been easier. I got a job before I moved, accommodation was sorted with family and I have a decent social network. Stuff has never been very important to me, but of course without reason to minimise stuff can accumulate. I am now down to only a suitcase and backpack.
#### Milestones/Accomplishments/Failures
#### Metrics
Less than a suitcase amount of stuff? Yes
#### Rating
10/10
#### What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
N/A


### 4. Money & Finances ###

*The past year...*
#### 1. What went well?
- Significant proportion of funds funds into ETFs
- Taking advantage of credit points for travel

#### 2. What did not go well?
- I haven't quite got a methodical overview/approach to my assets

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
- Earning money through side projects.

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
- Getting in on investments early - e.g. laziness was the only reason I didn't invest in ETH at the beginning of the year

#### Do I have savings? How much? Where are they?
TBA

#### What is the status of my assets and investments?
Need to figure out my risk tolerance and apply that in quantitative terms to where my money is. To date I have rather lazily left my money in savings accounts.
#### Do I know where my money goes?
Monzo helps categorise expenditure. This is an area I am not too worried about. I don't spend a lot and that mostly spends from a lack of materialism. I earn a decent wage which covers any temporary 'lavish' expenditures.
#### Do I budget? What is my budget?
Nope.
#### Am I aware of how I spend my money?
Yes roughly.
#### How do I want to be spending my money?
Not frivously, but not miserly. Mainly, I like to be stingy with myself and generous with others.
#### Are my finances organized?
(TODO)Vaguely - I will create an app that gives me a dashboard of what is going on.
#### Do I have any (unwanted) debt?
No - this year marked the end of student debt.

#### Summary
Definitely an area I need to pay attention to. More out of opportunity cost of not placing money into better returns and taking more risk early on. I have proven in AUD terms that I can get a 6 figure (i.e. above avg income) in London or Sydney. This should assuage some of my hard landing worries that have led to a risk averse life to date.

#### Milestones/Accomplishments/Failures
- Got a well paying job in another city.

#### Metrics
Savings net positive? Yes
Rebalanced assets this year? No
Have a clear overview of where my money is? No

#### Rating
7/10
#### What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
Create a simple app to visualise my assets, there ROI and rough risk.


### 5. Career & Work ###

*The past year...*
#### 1. What went well?
- Made a positive direct impact on employee's lives. Scott, Karl, GP, Dylan, Chentda, Samir. Made a positive impact on the APS's open source policy and pushed as hard as I could on this front.
- Installed and setup for the ATO significant comms and analytics infrastructure.
- Reached the max heights I think I could reach as one of the youngest EL1s and the youngest acting EL2.

#### 2. What did not go well?
- Shinypro... who knows, wait and see what the fall out is. 

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
- ATO definitely tried my best to get as much done as possible.

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
- Current job, I'm not throwing myself at it enough. 

#### How do I make my money?
- Wage slave
- To a minor extent, investments.

#### What do I do? What is my position?
- Tech manager / Data Scientist... really I am a tech generalist that frequently falls into leadership.

#### What is my role? Where do I work?
Acrotrend - Waterloo, London.

#### Am I so good they can't ignore me?
Yeah - I think I've performed pretty well. Created the first produdct to be in the hands of clients from the new product/innovation team.

#### Does my career give me mastery, control, and purpose?
- Yes. The more skills I learn in tech the more control I have in life to create things... and eventually doing so on my own.

#### Am I engaged?
- Not entirely, I have found the motivation side difficult due to the problems/profit side of things. I.e. why do I feel motivated when these efforts end up with the reward in the hands of the owners of the company? Why do I care about some digital marketing agencies data? Well, I don't.

#### I well-positioned and networked within my industry?
Somewhat. I certainly had a reputation in the APS. Less so in the London market, but I don't think this is worrisome. I can get a job easily if needed.

#### How stressful is my career/work?
Not very, though this will increase with more dependent employees and faster delivery.

#### Summary
#### Milestones/Accomplishments/Failures
#### Metrics
- Applied for a job and got an offer? Yes
- Got a raise/promotion (even if temp)? Yes

#### Rating
8/10
#### What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
Quitting! But in the mean time, plan your weeks in advance. As people demand your time this is a must.

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?

## 8. Social Life & Relationships ##

*The past year...*
### 1. What went well?
- New friends 
- Decreasing time with old friends that don't add to your life
- Spending enough time with family to get the annoyances of having family!

### 2. What did not go well?
- GP

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
- Family... doing things with them. Going out of my way for them.

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
- I am getting better at being 'warmer and friendlier'. I think the Colombia trip making friends on the way and back. Being more tactile. But it still feels awkward with new people, and I know that is probably just normal. But I still want to default to being a hugger or kiss goodbye-er than a awkward penguin.

#### How is my home life?
Not bad. A little time consuming with M&R. It impacts my productivity and introvert time. The criticisms can be a little, well annoying rather than helpful. So many idiosyncracies to cater for, it's like walking on egg shells.
#### How is my relationship with the members of my immediate and extended family?
Good - and by virtue of time and proximity, strengthening. But of course, to the detriment of my family friends in Aus. But at this stage of life this makes most sense.
#### Am I a good friend?
I think so. To my closest friends I mostly have very praising feedback.
#### How many core friends do I have? How large are my social circles?
Core is dynamic. Having just moved countries my core group is left behind. My closest friend now is Alina. Gitanjali, Jono, Ben, James, Jeremy are either back in Aus or around the world themselves. However, my core friends are those where I can pick up where we left off.
#### Am I cared for, loved, and valued by others?
Yes. 
#### Are my partner and I aware of each otherâ€™s needs and desires?
N/A
#### What clubs, organizations, and communities am I a member of?
I have quit Fabians, Labour(?) and the CPSU this year. In London, I have been to 3 different meetups. Two I will attend regularly, philosophy and pydata.
#### Do I have influence and status in my social circles? In society?
I think yes. People seem to respect me, I think that is mostly for knowledge and a friendly enough demeanor. Society, I'm growing my presense on github and my blog.
#### Summary
Social life I would rate well. I have close connections and make time for people who have love and lots to offer the world. 
#### Milestones/Accomplishments/Failures
New super close friend Alina
#### Metrics
Quantifying relationships!?
#### Rating
8/10
#### What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
I think on the non-platonic relationship side of things, seeing a counsellor/psych to learn more about myself and be more aware of my behaviour/mental patterns would be helpful in opening myself up more.

### 9. Emotions & Well-Being ###

*The past year...*
#### 1. What went well?
- Completed the 10 day meditations on Headspace

#### 2. What did not go well?
- Opening up to someone new caused a very anxious day (Kelly)

#### 3. Where did you try hard?
- I tried to do more yoga and meditation. And well, more than any other year.
- To open up freely and without being too obtuse.

#### 4. Where did you not try hard enough?
- Could definitely do more meditation and mindfulness. But I think I have a pretty equilibrium. I just have to be aware of the London bubble where life just takes over.

#### How do I feel about my life?
Pretty good. Plenty of promise and options.
#### Am I enjoying life?
Yes. It is rich. I travel regularly. I have plenty of new experiences and the resources to not hold me back.
#### Am I generally optimistic or pessimistic?
Optimistic.
#### Am I generally positive or negative?
Positive.
#### Am I easily aware of my current emotional state?
Yes.
#### Am I quick to notice how my emotions are influencing my thoughts, actions, and decisions?
Yes.
#### Do I have a regular mindfulness practice?
No - but I do deploy it as soon as I am aware of my steady state being worse than normal.
#### Do I practice self-compassion?
